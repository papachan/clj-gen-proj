### Clojure generator project

This generator uses three types of templates: Basic, Backend and Fullstack.

- Starting by a basic project structure choose a `Basic` project
- Basic backend project ( api with swagger ) choose `Backend` project.
- A complete fullstack project ( clojure files and clojurescript files at the same level ) choose `Fullstack`.
